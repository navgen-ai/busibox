```bash
cd tools/mcp-server
bash setup.sh
```

This will:
1. Install dependencies
2. Build the server
3. Configure Claude Desktop and/or Cursor
4. Display usage information

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

```bash
# Install and build
cd tools/mcp-server
npm install
npm run build

# Add to Claude Desktop config
# Edit: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "busibox": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/busibox/tools/mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}

# Or add to Cursor MCP settings

{
  "script_path": "scripts/deploy-ai-portal.sh"
}
```

**Natural Language**:
- "Tell me about the deploy-ai-portal.sh script"
- "What does test-infrastructure.sh do?"
- "Show me all deployment scripts"
- "Find scripts that run on Proxmox host"

### 4. Getting Deployment Help

**Goal**: Deploy a service to test or production

**Using Prompts**:
```json
Prompt: deploy_service
{
  "service": "ai-portal",
  "environment": "test"
}
```

**Natural Language**:
- "How do I deploy ai-portal to test?"
- "Walk me through deploying agent-lxc to production"
- "What are the steps to deploy a service?"

### 5. Troubleshooting Issues

**Goal**: Diagnose and fix problems

**Using Prompts**:
```json
Prompt: troubleshoot_issue
{
  "issue_type": "container"
}
```

**Natural Language**:
- "Help me troubleshoot a container issue"
- "How do I debug deployment problems?"
- "Service won't start, what should I check?"

### 6. Adding New Features

**Goal**: Add a new service to Busibox

**Using Prompts**:
```json
Prompt: add_service
{
  "service_name": "my-new-service"
}
```

**Natural Language**:
- "How do I add a new service called analytics?"
- "Walk me through creating a new LXC container"
- "What's the process for adding a new component?"

### 7. Creating Documentation

**Goal**: Write documentation following project standards

**Using Prompts**:
```json
Prompt: create_documentation
{
  "topic": "new-feature"
}
```

**Natural Language**:
- "How do I document the new analytics service?"
- "Where should deployment documentation go?"
- "What's the format for architecture docs?"

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Deploying to Test Environment

**Scenario**: You need to deploy the ai-portal service to the test environment.

**Step 1**: Understand the deployment process
```
You: "How do I deploy ai-portal to test?"
[MCP uses deploy_service prompt]
```

**Step 2**: Get detailed deployment info
```
You: "Show me the test environment configuration"
[MCP uses get_deployment_info tool]
```

**Step 3**: Review the deployment script
```
You: "Tell me about scripts/deploy-ai-portal.sh"
[MCP uses get_script_info tool]
```

**Step 4**: Check related documentation
```
You: "Show me the ai-portal deployment guide"
[MCP uses get_doc tool or searches docs]
```

### Example 2: Troubleshooting a Container

**Scenario**: A container isn't starting properly.

**Step 1**: Get troubleshooting guidance
```
You: "Help me troubleshoot a container issue"
[MCP uses troubleshoot_issue prompt]
```

**Step 2**: Find container information
```
You: "Show me all LXC containers and their IPs"
[MCP uses list_containers tool]
```

**Step 3**: Search for similar issues
```
You: "Search troubleshooting docs for container startup"
[MCP uses search_docs tool]
```

**Step 4**: Review architecture
```
You: "Show me the container architecture documentation"
[MCP reads architecture resource]
```

### Example 3: Understanding Project Organization

**Scenario**: New developer needs to understand where things go.

**Step 1**: Read organization rules
```
You: "Show me the project organization rules"
[MCP reads busibox://rules]
```

**Step 2**: Understand documentation structure
```
You: "Search organization docs for documentation placement"
[MCP uses search_docs on organization docs]
```

**Step 3**: Find script organization
```
You: "Where do admin workstation scripts go?"
[MCP reads script organization rules]
```

**Step 4**: Browse examples
```
You: "Show me all documentation in the architecture category"
[MCP reads busibox://docs/architecture]
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Effective Searching

1. **Use specific keywords**: "GPU passthrough" rather than just "GPU"
2. **Specify category when known**: Limit search to relevant category
3. **Try variations**: "deploy", "deployment", "deploying" may yield different results
4. **Search before asking**: Check if documentation exists before requesting new docs

### For Script Information

1. **Use relative paths**: `scripts/deploy-ai-portal.sh` not `/full/path/to/script`
2. **Check execution context**: Know whether script runs on workstation, host, or container
3. **Review dependencies**: Check what tools the script needs
4. **Read usage examples**: Script headers contain usage information

### For Documentation

1. **Start with quickstart**: Always begin with `busibox://quickstart`
2. **Check organization rules**: Understand structure before creating docs
3. **Browse by category**: Use category resources to see what exists
4. **Cross-reference**: Look at related docs mentioned in metadata

### For Deployments

1. **Test first**: Always deploy to test before production
2. **Follow prompts**: Use deployment prompts for step-by-step guidance
3. **Validate after**: Check service status after deployment
4. **Document issues**: Add troubleshooting docs for any problems encountered

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Multiple Queries

You can combine resources and tools for comprehensive understanding:

```
1. Read busibox://architecture (understand system)
2. Tool: list_containers (see what exists)
3. Tool: find_scripts with context="proxmox-host" (see host scripts)
4. Tool: get_deployment_info for environment="test" (see test config)
5. Tool: search_docs for query="LXC creation" (find docs)
```

### Custom Workflows

Create your own workflows for common tasks:

**Adding a Feature Workflow**:
1. Search docs for similar features
2. Review architecture to understand integration points
3. Find scripts that might need updating
4. Use add_service prompt for new components
5. Use create_documentation prompt for docs

**Debugging Workflow**:
1. Use troubleshoot_issue prompt for initial guidance
2. Search troubleshooting docs for similar issues
3. Get script info for relevant diagnostic scripts
4. List containers to identify affected services
5. Get deployment info to verify configuration

### Integration with Development

Use the MCP server during development:

**Before Making Changes**:
- Review organization rules
