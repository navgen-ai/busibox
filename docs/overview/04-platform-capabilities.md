# Platform Capabilities

[Back to Why Busibox](00-why-busibox.md)

Busibox is not a single tool — it's a platform that integrates document processing, search, AI agents, and custom applications into a unified system. This page describes what the platform can do and how the pieces fit together.

## Document Processing

Upload documents and Busibox handles the rest. The ingestion pipeline converts raw files into searchable, AI-ready content through a series of automated steps:

1. **Upload**: Files are stored in MinIO (S3-compatible object storage). Deduplication by SHA-256 hash prevents redundant processing.
2. **Text Extraction**: Multi-strategy extraction handles different document types — Marker for PDFs, standard parsers for Office documents, OCR fallback for scanned content. An LLM cleanup pass corrects extraction artifacts.
3. **Semantic Chunking**: Documents are split into semantically coherent chunks (400-800 tokens with overlap) that preserve context boundaries rather than cutting at arbitrary character counts.
4. **Embedding**: Each chunk is embedded using FastEmbed (dense vectors) with optional ColPali visual embeddings for diagram-heavy documents. BM25 sparse terms are generated in parallel for keyword matching.
5. **Indexing**: Vectors are stored in Milvus with partition keys tied to the document's visibility settings (personal or shared by role). Metadata goes to PostgreSQL with RLS policies.

**Supported formats**: PDF, Word (.docx), Excel (.xlsx), PowerPoint (.pptx), images (with OCR), Markdown, plain text, and more.

The pipeline runs asynchronously — users can continue working while documents are processed. Real-time status updates stream via server-sent events so users can track progress.

### Schema-Driven Extraction

Beyond raw text, Busibox can extract structured data from documents using schemas. When a document type has an associated schema, the platform uses AI to extract specific fields — dates, names, amounts, categories — into structured records that can be queried, filtered, and visualized. Schemas can be created manually or auto-generated from sample documents.

## Hybrid Search

Search in Busibox combines multiple retrieval strategies to find the most relevant results:

- **Vector search** (semantic): Find content by meaning, even when the query uses different words than the document. Powered by Milvus with dense embeddings.
- **BM25 search** (keyword): Traditional keyword matching for queries where exact terms matter — part numbers, names, codes.
- **Graph-based retrieval**: Entity relationships extracted during ingestion enable graph-aware context expansion, connecting related concepts across documents.
- **LLM reranking**: After initial retrieval, an LLM reranker scores results for relevance, pushing the most useful content to the top.

All search is permission-aware. The search service reads the user's JWT, builds a list of accessible partitions (personal + role-based), and restricts retrieval to those partitions. Users never see results from documents they don't have access to.

## AI Agents

Agents are the conversational interface to the platform. They combine LLM reasoning with tools that access your data and the web:

### Core Agent Capabilities

- **Document search (RAG)**: Agents search your documents using the hybrid search pipeline, retrieve relevant passages, and synthesize answers with citations pointing back to source documents.
- **Web search**: When documents don't have the answer, agents can search the web, scrape relevant pages, and incorporate external information.
- **File attachments**: Upload files directly in chat. Agents analyze attached documents in context.
- **Conversation memory**: Agents remember the conversation history and can build on previous exchanges.

### Agent Architecture

The Agent API orchestrates requests through specialized sub-agents:

- A **dispatch agent** routes incoming queries to the appropriate specialist
- A **RAG search agent** handles document-grounded questions
- A **web search agent** handles external information needs
- An **attachment agent** processes uploaded files

Agents inherit the requesting user's permissions through token exchange. An agent serving a user with access to HR documents can search those documents; the same agent serving a user without HR access cannot.

### Custom Agents

Administrators can define custom agents with specific system prompts, tool configurations, and model assignments. Examples include:

- A **news agent** that scrapes specified sources on a schedule and synthesizes summaries into stored documents
- A **status update agent** that guides users through structured project updates
- A **research assistant** with access to specific document collections and web search

Agents can be assigned to specific roles, so different teams see different agents tailored to their workflows.

## Chat and Messaging

Users interact with agents through multiple channels:

- **Web interface**: Full-featured chat in the AI Portal with thinking indicators, streaming responses, citations, file attachments, and conversation history.
- **Bridge channels**: The Bridge service connects agents to external messaging platforms — Telegram, Signal, Discord, WhatsApp, and email. Users can ask questions and receive AI-powered responses without opening the web platform.

Bridge channels adapt formatting to each platform's capabilities (Telegram markdown, WhatsApp formatting, SMS length limits) with text fallbacks for channels that don't support rich content.

## Application Ecosystem

Busibox is a platform for building and running applications, not just a standalone tool.

### Core Applications

Every Busibox installation includes:

- **AI Portal**: The main dashboard — document management, search, settings, user administration
- **Agent Manager**: Configure agents, manage conversations, define workflows and scheduled tasks

### Custom Applications

Developers build applications on Busibox using:

- **Next.js** with the `@jazzmind/busibox-app` library, which provides authentication, API clients, theming, and UI components
- **Busibox SSO**: Apps authenticate through the same Zero Trust token exchange — no custom auth implementation needed
- **Data API access**: Apps store and retrieve structured data through the Data API with automatic RLS enforcement
- **AI integration**: Apps can invoke agents, run searches, and call LLMs through standard API endpoints

Applications deploy to the platform and immediately inherit security, data access, and AI capabilities. A developer building a project management app, for example, doesn't need to implement authentication, document search, or AI chat — those are platform services.

### App Builder

An AI-assisted app builder (in development) enables rapid app creation through conversational development. Describe what you need, and the builder generates, deploys, and iterates on applications within the platform — with browser-based testing and log access during development.

### App Library

Applications can be published to a shared library for installation by other Busibox deployments, or kept as private deployments for a single organization.

## Infrastructure and Operations

Busibox includes the operational tooling needed to run in production:

- **Ansible IaC**: Infrastructure defined as code with Ansible roles for every service. Deployments are repeatable and auditable.
- **Unified `make` interface**: A single command interface for deploying, managing, restarting, and monitoring all services. Secrets from Ansible Vault are automatically injected.
- **Multi-environment support**: Run staging and production on the same or separate hosts with isolated configurations.
- **Health monitoring**: Container health checks, service status dashboards, and log aggregation.
- **Dual backend support**: The same Ansible roles deploy to Docker (for development and smaller deployments) or Proxmox LXC containers (for production).
