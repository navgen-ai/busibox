# Why Busibox

## The Problem

Organizations adopting AI today face a set of uncomfortable trade-offs:

- **Data sovereignty vs. capability.** Cloud AI platforms offer powerful models, but every document, conversation, and query passes through third-party infrastructure. For companies handling sensitive contracts, HR data, competitive intelligence, or regulated information, this is often a non-starter.
- **Fragmented tools.** Teams end up stitching together separate products for document storage, search, chat, embeddings, and AI agents — each with its own authentication, data model, and vendor relationship.
- **Vendor lock-in.** Committing to a single AI provider means accepting their pricing, their model choices, their data handling policies, and their roadmap. Switching costs grow with every document ingested and every workflow built.
- **Security gaps.** Most AI tools were not designed with enterprise-grade access control. Documents uploaded to a shared AI assistant are often visible to everyone, with no concept of roles, permissions, or audit trails.

These aren't hypothetical risks. They're the day-to-day reality for organizations trying to move beyond basic ChatGPT usage into AI that actually integrates with their operations.

## What Busibox Is

Busibox is the AI equivalent of a Linux distribution. It brings together all the components an organization needs to run AI — document processing, semantic search, intelligent agents, and custom applications — into a single self-hosted platform that runs on your infrastructure.

Like a Linux distribution, Busibox doesn't reinvent every component. It selects, integrates, and configures best-in-class open-source tools (PostgreSQL, Milvus, MinIO, vLLM, LiteLLM, FastEmbed, and more) into a cohesive system with unified authentication, consistent security, and a shared data model. The result is a platform where everything works together out of the box, but individual components can be swapped or extended as needs change.

Busibox runs on Docker or Proxmox LXC containers. It supports local LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs or Apple Silicon, frontier models from OpenAI, Anthropic, or AWS Bedrock, or any combination — routed intelligently based on task requirements and data sensitivity.

## Key Benefits

### Own Your AI Stack

Your documents, conversations, embeddings, and search indexes live on your infrastructure. Nothing leaves your network unless you explicitly configure it to. You choose which models process which data, and you can run entirely on local LLMs for maximum privacy.

### Secure by Design

Busibox implements Zero Trust authentication with RS256-signed JWTs, Row-Level Security in PostgreSQL, and container isolation for every service. Users only see documents they're authorized to access. AI agents inherit the permissions of the user they serve — they cannot access data the user cannot access.

### Hybrid AI

A LiteLLM gateway routes AI requests to local models (vLLM on NVIDIA, MLX on Apple Silicon) or frontier providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock), selectable per agent and per task. Sensitive documents can be restricted to local-only processing, while complex analytical tasks can leverage the most capable model available.

### Unified Platform

Documents, search, agents, chat, and applications share the same infrastructure, the same authentication, and the same permission model. Upload a document once, and it's available to search, to agents, and to every app on the platform — with consistent access control throughout.

### Build and Deploy Apps

Busibox is not just a tool — it's a platform. Developers can build Next.js applications using the `@jazzmind/busibox-app` library and deploy them with instant access to AI services, document search, and security. An AI-assisted app builder enables rapid development of domain-specific tools without starting from scratch.

### Production-Ready Infrastructure

Busibox is not a prototype or a demo. It includes Ansible-based infrastructure-as-code for repeatable deployments, a unified `make` command interface for service management, multi-environment support (staging and production), container health monitoring, and comprehensive logging. It's designed to be operated, not just installed.

## Who It's For

**Enterprise teams** that need AI capabilities but cannot send sensitive data to cloud providers. Busibox gives them a private AI stack with the same categories of capability — document intelligence, semantic search, conversational agents — running entirely within their network boundary.

**Consultancies and service firms** that build solutions for clients across industries. Busibox provides ready infrastructure and a library of deployable applications, dramatically reducing the time from concept to working solution. Build once, customize per client.

**Regulated industries** (legal, finance, healthcare, government) where data residency, audit trails, and access control are not optional but mandatory. Busibox's architecture — RLS, RBAC, encryption at rest, container isolation — addresses these requirements at the infrastructure level.

**AI-native organizations** that want complete control over their AI stack without the overhead of integrating dozens of open-source tools themselves. Busibox handles the integration, configuration, and operational tooling so teams can focus on building applications and solving problems.

## What's Included

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Document Processing** | Upload PDFs, Word, Excel, images, and more. Automatic text extraction, semantic chunking, and vector embedding. |
| **Hybrid Search** | Vector search, BM25 keyword search, and graph-based retrieval — combined with LLM reranking for accurate results. |
| **AI Agents** | Chat assistants with access to your documents, web search, and custom tools. Agents respect user permissions. |
| **Applications** | Core apps (AI Portal, Agent Manager) plus custom apps built on the platform. |
| **LLM Gateway** | Route requests to local or cloud models. Supports vLLM, MLX, OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, and more. |
| **Authentication** | Zero Trust OAuth2 with passkey, TOTP, and magic link login. RBAC and RLS enforce access control. |
| **Bridge Channels** | Connect AI agents to Telegram, Signal, Discord, WhatsApp, and email. |
| **Infrastructure Tooling** | Ansible IaC, `make` command interface, multi-environment support, health monitoring. |
