"""
Port Allocator for User Apps
=============================

Manages dynamic port assignment for user (sandboxed) apps to prevent
port conflicts when multiple apps declare the same defaultPort in their
manifest (common since the template defaults to 3002).

Resolution strategy (in order):
1. Reuse persisted port if this app was previously assigned one.
2. Use the manifest's preferred port if no other app has claimed it.
3. Allocate the next free port from the dynamic range (4100-4999).

Persistence:
  Port assignments are stored in /tmp/busibox_port_assignments.json
  alongside the existing running-apps registry.  Assignments survive
  deploy-api restarts; they are released on undeploy.
