Integration tests for dispatcher routing (User Story 2).

Tests:
- Document queries route to doc_search with high confidence
- Web queries route to web_search
- Disabled tools are not selected
- No available tools returns confidence=0
- File attachments route to file-capable tools
- Routing accuracy meets 95%+ target (SC-002)
