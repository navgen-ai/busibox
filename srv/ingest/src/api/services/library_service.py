Library Service for managing document libraries.

Handles library CRUD operations, personal library management, and folder resolution.
This service consolidates library management that was previously split between
AI Portal and ingest-api.

- Libraries table does NOT have RLS (application-level filtering)
- ingestion_files table HAS RLS - requires app.user_id session variable
- All queries to ingestion_files must go through acquire_with_rls() context manager
