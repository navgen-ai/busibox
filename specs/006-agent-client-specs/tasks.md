# Tasks: Agent-Server API Enhancements

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-agent-client-specs/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, spec.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/openapi.yaml ✅

**Tests**: Tests are included based on success criteria in spec.md (SC-002: 95%+ routing accuracy, SC-006: 100% security validation)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Backend API: `srv/agent/app/` for application code
- Tests: `srv/agent/tests/` for test code
- Migrations: `srv/agent/alembic/versions/` for database migrations
- Ansible: `provision/ansible/roles/agent/` for deployment

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 → US2 → US3 → US4 → US5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

**Note**: All user stories are independently implementable after Foundational phase completes

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: T003, T004 can run in parallel
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: T007-T012 (all model updates) can run in parallel
- **User Story 1**: T015 (tests) can run in parallel with implementation after they fail
- **User Story 2**: T021-T023 (all tests) can run in parallel; T024 (schemas) can run in parallel with T025 (agent implementation)
- **User Story 3**: T031-T033 (all tests) can run in parallel; T034, T038, T043 (all schemas) can run in parallel; T035-T037 (tool endpoints), T039-T042 (workflow endpoints), T044-T046 (evaluator endpoints) can run in parallel after schemas complete
- **User Story 4**: T048 (tests) can run in parallel with implementation after they fail; T049, T051 (schemas and validation) can run in parallel
- **User Story 5**: T054 (tests) can run in parallel with implementation after they fail
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: T060-T068 (all polish tasks) can run in parallel
- **Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members**

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Dispatcher)

```bash
# After Foundational phase completes, launch User Story 2 tasks:

# Launch all tests together (write tests first, ensure they FAIL):
Task T021: "Unit tests for dispatcher service in srv/agent/tests/unit/test_dispatcher.py"
Task T022: "Integration tests for dispatcher routing in srv/agent/tests/integration/test_dispatcher_routing.py"
Task T023: "Create test query dataset in srv/agent/tests/fixtures/dispatcher_queries.json"

# After tests fail, launch schemas and agent implementation in parallel:
Task T024: "Create Pydantic schemas for dispatcher in srv/agent/app/schemas/dispatcher.py"
Task T025: "Implement dispatcher agent in srv/agent/app/agents/dispatcher.py"

# Then sequential tasks:
Task T026: "Implement dispatcher service in srv/agent/app/services/dispatcher_service.py"
Task T027: "Implement decision logging in srv/agent/app/services/dispatcher_service.py"
Task T028: "Create /dispatcher/route POST endpoint in srv/agent/app/api/routes/dispatcher.py"
Task T029: "Implement Redis caching for dispatcher"
Task T030: "Add dispatcher performance monitoring"

# Verify tests now PASS
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 3 (CRUD Operations)

```bash
# After Foundational phase completes, launch User Story 3 tasks:

# Launch all tests together (write tests first, ensure they FAIL):
Task T031: "Integration tests for tool CRUD in srv/agent/tests/integration/test_tool_crud.py"
Task T032: "Integration tests for workflow CRUD in srv/agent/tests/integration/test_workflow_crud.py"
Task T033: "Integration tests for evaluator CRUD in srv/agent/tests/integration/test_evaluator_crud.py"

# After tests fail, launch all schemas in parallel:
Task T034: "Create Pydantic schemas for tool updates in srv/agent/app/schemas/tool.py"
Task T038: "Create Pydantic schemas for workflow updates in srv/agent/app/schemas/workflow.py"
Task T043: "Create Pydantic schemas for evaluator updates in srv/agent/app/schemas/evaluator.py"

# Then launch all endpoint groups in parallel:
# Tool endpoints (T035-T037)
# Workflow endpoints (T039-T042)
# Evaluator endpoints (T044-T046)
# Conflict detection service (T047)

# Verify tests now PASS
```

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (critical path)
2. **Once Foundational is done, split by user story**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Personal Agent Management)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Intelligent Query Routing)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Tool/Workflow CRUD)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Schedule Management)
3. **Stories complete and integrate independently**
4. **Optional**: Developer E can work on User Story 5 (Workflow Resume) in parallel

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 68

**Tasks by Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 4 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 10 tasks (BLOCKING)
- Phase 3 (US1 - Personal Agents): 6 tasks (1 test + 5 implementation)
- Phase 4 (US2 - Dispatcher): 10 tasks (3 tests + 7 implementation)
- Phase 5 (US3 - CRUD Operations): 17 tasks (3 tests + 14 implementation)
- Phase 6 (US4 - Schedule Management): 6 tasks (1 test + 5 implementation)
- Phase 7 (US5 - Workflow Resume): 6 tasks (1 test + 5 implementation) [OPTIONAL]
- Phase 8 (Polish): 9 tasks

**Tasks by User Story**:
- US1 (Personal Agent Management): 6 tasks
- US2 (Intelligent Query Routing): 10 tasks
- US3 (Tool and Workflow Management): 17 tasks
- US4 (Schedule Management): 6 tasks
- US5 (Workflow Resume): 6 tasks [OPTIONAL]
- Shared/Polish: 23 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 35 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Create agent as User A → User B cannot see it
- US2: Submit query → dispatcher routes correctly with 95%+ accuracy
- US3: Create tool → update → delete (with conflict detection)
- US4: Update schedule → verify APScheduler synced
- US5: Resume failed workflow → verify steps not re-executed

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Stories 1 & 2 (16 tasks after Foundational)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests written FIRST (TDD approach) for all user stories
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- User Story 5 (Workflow Resume) is optional - can be deferred to future iteration
