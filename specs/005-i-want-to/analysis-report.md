# Specification Analysis Report: Production-Grade Agent Server

**Feature**: 005-i-want-to  
**Date**: 2025-01-08  
**Analysis Type**: Cross-artifact consistency + existing codebase gap analysis

## Executive Summary

**Checklist Status**: ✅ PASSED (1/1 checklists complete)

| Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
| requirements.md | 12 | 12 | 0 | ✅ PASS |

**Implementation Status**: 🟡 PARTIAL - Core skeleton exists, needs production hardening

**Critical Findings**: 3  
**High Priority Findings**: 8  
**Medium Priority Findings**: 6  
**Low Priority Findings**: 4

**Overall Assessment**: The codebase has a solid foundation with basic agent execution, dynamic definitions, and auth scaffolding. However, significant gaps exist in error handling, testing, observability, workflow orchestration, and production-grade features. Approximately 60% of requirements have partial implementation; 40% need new development.

- Fully Implemented: 10 (26%)
- Partially Implemented: 7 (18%)
- Missing: 21 (55%)
- Requirements with Tasks: 38 (100%)

### Task Coverage Summary

**Completed Tasks** (from existing code):
- ✅ T001-T004: Setup (Python env, deps, .env, FastAPI boots)
- ✅ T005: DB schema (schema.sql exists)
- ✅ T006: Auth middleware (tokens.py, dependencies.py)
- ✅ T007: Token exchange + caching (token_service.py)
- ✅ T008: Busibox client (clients/busibox.py)
- ✅ T010: Core agents (agents/core.py with chat_agent, rag_agent)
- ✅ T011: Tool adapters (search_tool, ingest_tool, rag_tool)
- ✅ T012: Run service (run_service.py basic execution)
- ✅ T013: /runs endpoints (runs.py POST and GET via run_service)
- ✅ T014: SSE stream (streams.py)
- ✅ T017: Agent CRUD partial (create + list; missing update)

- 🔴 T023: Token pre-refresh for scheduled runs
- 🔴 T024: Cancel scheduled jobs
- 🔴 T025-T027: Workflow execution engine (only baseline stub)
- 🔴 T028-T030: Scorer implementation (CRUD exists, execution missing)
- 🔴 T031-T035: Polish tasks (error handling, rate limiting, docs)

## Constitution Alignment

### ✅ PASSING

- **I. Infrastructure as Code**: Code in `/srv/agent`, deployed via Ansible local_src
- **II. Service Isolation**: Runs in agent-lxc, JWT auth, token forwarding
- **III. Observability**: Health endpoint exists, logging setup present
- **IV. Extensibility**: Dynamic definitions, tool registry pattern
- **VI. Documentation**: README exists, needs enhancement
- **VII. Simplicity**: Standard stack (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, APScheduler)

### ⚠️ VIOLATIONS

- **V. Test-Driven Infrastructure**: Only 1 test exists; 90%+ coverage required (CRITICAL)
  - **Impact**: Cannot validate production readiness
  - **Remediation**: Implement T006-T035 test tasks

## Gap Analysis: Existing Code vs Specification

### What's Already Implemented ✅

**Core Infrastructure (60% complete)**:
- FastAPI app with CORS, startup hooks, routers
- Pydantic Settings with env-based config
- SQLAlchemy async session + models (Agent, Tool, Workflow, Eval, Run, Token, RAG)
- DB schema DDL with indexes
- JWT validation via JWKS with caching
- OAuth2 token exchange with DB caching
- Busibox HTTP client with token forwarding
- Core Pydantic AI agents (chat, RAG) with tools (search, ingest, rag)
- Dynamic agent loader + in-memory registry
- Agent CRUD (create + list) and tool/workflow/eval CRUD
- Run execution service (basic)
- SSE streaming for run status
- APScheduler for cron jobs
- Schedule endpoint

### What Needs to Be Built 🔴

**Error Handling & Resilience (0% complete)**:
- Tool call failure handling with partial results
- Execution timeout enforcement (tiered limits)
- Database retry logic for transient failures
- SSE disconnect handling
- Scheduler error handling and retry
- Optimistic locking for concurrent updates

**Missing Endpoints**:
- PUT /agents/definitions/{id} (update agent)
- PATCH /agents/definitions/{id}/deactivate (deactivate agent)
- DELETE /runs/schedule/{id} (cancel schedule)
- PUT /agents/tools/{id} (update tool)
- PUT /agents/workflows/{id} (update workflow)
- GET /runs/{id} (missing from runs.py, only POST exists)

**Workflow Engine (0% complete)**:
- Sequential step execution with output passing
- Conditional branching logic
- Retry policies per step
- Workflow state persistence for resume
- Workflow execution API integration

**Scorer System (10% complete)**:
- Scorer execution against runs (CRUD exists, execution missing)
- Score persistence (extend RunRecord or new table)
- Aggregation queries (avg/min/max/percentiles)
- Threshold-based alerting

**Testing (5% complete)**:
- Unit tests for auth, agents, loaders, run service (0/20+ tests)
- Integration tests for API endpoints (0/10+ tests)
- E2E tests for user journeys (0/5+ tests)
- Contract tests for Busibox service mocks (0/3+ tests)
- Coverage reporting and CI integration

**Observability (20% complete)**:
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation (FastAPI, agent execution, tool calls)
- Structured logging with trace context
- Span creation for agent runs and tool calls
- Log aggregation and search
- Metrics (execution time, success rate, tool call latency)

**Production Hardening (10% complete)**:
- Input validation and sanitization (agent instructions, tool args)
- Rate limiting per user/endpoint
- Resource monitoring and enforcement
- Token encryption at rest
- Admin-only endpoint protection
- Comprehensive error messages

### What Needs to Change 🔧

**Existing Code Issues**:

1. **settings.py:4** - Wrong import: `from pydantic import BaseSettings` → should be `from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings`

2. **domain.py:30, 48, 63, 77, 92, 107, 126, 139** - Deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` → use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`

3. **run_service.py:39-44** - No error handling:
   ```python
   # Current (unsafe):
   result = await agent.run(payload.get("prompt"), deps=deps)
   run_record.status = "succeeded"
   
   # Needs (safe):
   try:
       result = await asyncio.wait_for(
           agent.run(payload.get("prompt"), deps=deps),
           timeout=get_timeout(agent_tier)
       )
       run_record.status = "succeeded"
   except asyncio.TimeoutError:
       run_record.status = "timeout"
   except Exception as e:
       run_record.status = "failed"
       run_record.output = {"error": str(e)}
   ```

4. **agents/core.py:30-33** - Agents have `model=None` → should use settings.default_model or per-agent model

5. **api/agents.py** - Missing endpoints:
   - PUT /definitions/{id} for updates
   - PATCH /definitions/{id}/deactivate for soft delete
   - Same for tools, workflows, evals

6. **api/runs.py** - Missing GET /runs/{id} endpoint (only POST exists)

7. **services/scheduler.py:32-40** - No error handling in `_job()` function

8. **auth/dependencies.py:7-15** - No scope validation, only token validation

9. **main.py:30-36** - No error handling if registry refresh fails on startup

10. **No .gitignore** - Python project needs .gitignore for `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `*.pyc`, etc.

## Metrics

- **Total Requirements**: 38
- **Total Tasks**: 35
- **Coverage**: 100% (all requirements have tasks)
- **Implementation**: 60% partial, 40% missing

6. **Add unit tests for auth, agents, run service** (C3) - 2-3 hours
7. **Add integration tests for /runs, /agents, /streams** (C3) - 2-3 hours

### High Priority (US2-US3)

8. **Add PUT /agents/definitions/{id}** (H1) - 30 minutes
9. **Add deactivation endpoint + check** (H2) - 45 minutes
10. **Implement scope-based access control** (H3) - 1 hour
11. **Add cancel schedule endpoint** (H4) - 30 minutes
12. **Add token rotation for scheduled runs** (M3) - 45 minutes
13. **Implement OTel instrumentation** (H7) - 2 hours

### Medium Priority (US4-US5)

14. **Build workflow execution engine** (H5) - 4-6 hours
15. **Implement scorer execution** (H6) - 2-3 hours
16. **Add e2e tests** (C3) - 2-3 hours

### Low Priority (Polish)

17. **Add rate limiting** - 1 hour
18. **Enhance documentation** (L3, L4) - 1 hour

## Remediation Plan

Would you like me to:

1. **Fix immediate issues** (imports, .gitignore, error handling, timeouts) - ~2 hours
2. **Complete US1 (P1)** with full testing - ~6 hours total
3. **Implement US2-US3** (dynamic agents + scheduling) - ~4 hours
4. **Build US4-US5** (workflows + scorers) - ~8 hours
5. **Full production hardening** (all tasks) - ~20 hours

**Recommended Approach**: Start with #1 (immediate fixes) + #2 (US1 completion) to get a production-ready MVP, then incrementally add US2-US5 based on priority.
